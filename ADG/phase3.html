        <p>This website is dedicated to bringing attention to Americaâ€™s next up and coming sport: Disc Golf. Disc golf is a flying disc sport in which players throw a disc at a target. Disc Golf is similar to ball golf but has a lot of very intricate rules that make it an entirely different sport. Players complete a hole by throwing a disc toward the target, and then throwing again from where the disc landed, until the target is reached. Similar to golf, every hole has a par and the players final score is determined by how they did compared to the par.</p>
